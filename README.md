### Hello! I am a front-end developer with 1.5 years of experience specializing in web application development using <br> React, Redux, MUI, TypeScript, Webpack, babel, Redux-toolkit and Next.js.</br>

During this time, I gained experience in designing UI components, writing code to manage application state, interacting with the server side of an application, and optimizing application performance. I have worked with Redux tools like Redux-thunk and Redux-saga as well as Redux-toolkit for faster and more efficient development.

I'm also familiar with responsive design principles and using the MUI library to simplify user interface development. In addition, I have experience with TypeScript, which allows me to write more secure and maintainable code.

I am familiar with web application build tools such as Webpack and Babel and have experience with Next.js to build server-rendered applications.

I am always striving for self-improvement and improvement of my skills, so I try to learn new technologies and tools. I work well in a team and I am ready to share my knowledge and experience with other developers so that we can create high-quality and efficient code together.
